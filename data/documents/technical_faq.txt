## Development Practices

### Q: What is our branching strategy?
A: We follow GitFlow:
- main: production-ready code
- develop: integration branch
- feature/*: feature branches
- hotfix/*: urgent production fixes
Always create pull requests for code review before merging.

### Q: What are the code review requirements?
A: All code must be reviewed by at least one senior developer before merging. Reviews should check for:
- Code quality and best practices
- Test coverage (minimum 80%)
- Documentation
- Security vulnerabilities

### Q: How often should we deploy?
A: We follow continuous deployment:
- Development: automatic on merge to develop
- Staging: daily at 2 PM
- Production: weekly on Thursdays, or as needed for hotfixes

## Infrastructure

### Q: Where are our applications hosted?
A: Production applications run on Azure App Service. Databases use Azure SQL Database. We use Azure Blob Storage for file storage and Azure Redis Cache for caching.

### Q: How do I access production logs?
A: Use Azure Application Insights for application logs. Access requires production read permissions. Request access through the IT portal.

### Q: What is our backup policy?
A: Automated daily backups at 2 AM UTC. Retention: 30 days for databases, 90 days for critical data. Disaster recovery drills conducted quarterly.

## Security

### Q: How should I store API keys and secrets?
A: Never commit secrets to Git. Use Azure Key Vault for production secrets. For local development, use .env files (listed in .gitignore).

### Q: What is the password policy?

- At least 12 characters
